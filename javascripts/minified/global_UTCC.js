       cyborgs.  On today's battlefield, AI assisted soldiers are a requirement.  The average \
       human simply cannot process fast enough to be effective.  Combat AIs allow soldiers to \
       focus on the battle at hand by keeping track of other miscellaneous activities such as \
       Friend-or-Foe recognition, ammo tracking, and mission updates.","The tank of today is more or less the same as the tank of yesterday, with a few important \
       exceptions.  Firstly, all tank operators are full or partial conversion cyborgs allowing \
       them to directly interface with the tank.  This has increased the response time and \
       survivability of tank crews exponentially.  An average of two crew members interface with the \
       weapons systems giving accurate, independent targeting for up to four weapons.  The remaining \
       crew members perform other miscellaneous tasks within the tank such as reloading standard \
       ammunition or replacing spent fuel cells and maintaining the tank when not in active service.","The Juggernaut is the epitome of combat technology.  A crew of 8 pilot this behemoth on the \
       battlefield.  Equipped with state-of-the-art combat technologies, such as the Quantum Anomaly \
       Enabler or Singularity Whip, this lumbering hulk can inflict massive damage on unprepared \
       foes.  A remaining crew of 2 military engineers are with the Juggernaut at all times, when not in combat, \
       to repair damage and keep all the systems fully calibrated.","The bomber is the only offensive unit capable of delivering the extremely powerful Tier 4 Weapons \
       of Mass Destruction. Capable of annihilating entire cities and leaving nothing behind, the bombers \
       that carry these weapons are generally quite weak. Due to weight limitations, most bombers are \
       lightly armored and rely on ground forces to clear the way for them."],};
